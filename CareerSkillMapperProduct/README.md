```javascript
const stemFields = [
  {
    id: "science",
    name: "Science",
    description: "...",
    subcategories: [
      {
        id: "biology",
        name: "Biology",
        jobTypes: ["Microbiologist", "Biochemist", ...]
      },
      // More subcategories...
    ]
  },
  // More STEM fields...
];
```

### jobs

    duration: "6 months",
    cost: "$500",
    difficulty: "Advanced",
    category: "technology"
  },
  // More certifications...
];
```

### jobCertifications
Maps jobs to required certifications:

```javascript
const jobCertifications = [
  {
    id: 1,
    jobId: 1,
    certificationId: 1,
    importance: "Essential"
  },
  // More mappings...
];
```

### careerPaths
Contains career progression pathways:

```javascript
const careerPaths = [
  {
    id: 1,
    jobId: 1,
    title: "Data Scientist Career Path",
    description: "...",
    steps: [
      {
        title: "Junior Data Analyst",
        description: "...",
        skills: ["SQL", "Excel", ...]
      },
      // More steps...
    ]
  },
  // More career paths...
];
```

## üîÑ How to Add or Modify Data

All data modifications are done in the `html/js/data.js` file.

### Adding a New STEM Field Subcategory
1. Open `js/data.js`
2. Find the appropriate STEM field in the `stemFields` array
3. Add a new subcategory to its `subcategories` array:

```javascript
{
  id: "subcategory-id",
  name: "Subcategory Name",
  jobTypes: ["Job Type 1", "Job Type 2", ...]
}
```

### Adding a New Job
1. Add a new object to the `jobs` array:

```javascript
{
  id: [NEXT_AVAILABLE_ID],
  title: "Job Title",
  description: "Job description...",
  category: "technology|science|engineering|mathematics",
  subcategory: "subcategory-id",
  level: "entry|mid|senior",
  duration: "full-time|part-time|contract",

- Mobile (below 768px)

The layout adjusts automatically using CSS media queries defined in `styles.css`.

## üîß JavaScript Functions

The `main.js` file contains several useful functions:

- `getAllJobs()` - Returns all job listings
- `getJobById(id)` - Gets a job by its ID
