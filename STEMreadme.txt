Prerequisites

Steps to Self-Host
1. Download the Project Files
First, download all the project files from Replit. You can do this by:

Clicking on the three dots (â‹®) in the files panel
Selecting "Download as ZIP"
Extracting the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
2. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:
